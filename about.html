        <p>About Me
            At 22, I’m a passionate and adaptable Computer Science undergraduate with a zest for learning and innovation. My energy and enthusiasm light up every room, and I’m always eager to explore new ideas, share knowledge, and make meaningful contributions.
           
            Passions and Interests
            I’m deeply fascinated by technology, with a special focus on web development and artificial intelligence. Experimenting with cutting-edge frameworks and algorithms is my creative playground, where I turn ideas into functional, impactful projects. Beyond technology, I find joy in storytelling—sharing my journey, coding insights, and life lessons through blogs that inspire and connect with others.
            
            Hobbies
            When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me strumming my guitar, creating music with friends, or planning my next travel adventure. Traveling fuels my curiosity, offering lessons that shape my perspective. Capturing these moments through photography and vlogging allows me to relive and share my experiences, blending creativity with exploration.
            
            Leadership and Personality
            As a natural leader, I thrive on building connections and fostering collaboration. Currently leading my college’s tech club, I guide juniors, organize hackathons, and spearhead tech fests that ignite innovation. My approachable and dependable nature makes me a go-to person for support, advice, and teamwork, both personally and professionally.
            
            Vision for the Future
            My dream is to launch a tech company dedicated to creating sustainable, real-world solutions. I aim to build a culture of innovation paired with compassion, where every team member feels valued and empowered to achieve greatness. This vision inspires me to keep learning, growing, and striving for meaningful impact.
